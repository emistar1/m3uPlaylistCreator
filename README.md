# m3uPlaylistCreator
A easy way of creating m3u playlists
This is more of a personal project so that i can convert my .flac and .mp3 files into a playlist for my DAP 
It curently has only two options one for a classic m3u file and the other for M0/M0 pro DAP m3u playlist as that dap requires special formatting witch is:
```
A:/path-to-song/song.(flac/mp3)
```
